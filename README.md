The executable jar file is located in the "OOB_Assignment_Three" folder.

After running the program, the user will be prompted to enter a number between one and nine. These numbers correspond to eight different unit conversions. If nine is entered the program will end.

After selecting which conversion the user would like to process, they will be prompted again to enter the amount of units that they would like to convert.

The program will the calculate and print the conversion to the console. This can be repeated as many times as the user would like.
